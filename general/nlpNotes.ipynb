    "        - Allows for capture of dependencies between preceding and following words.\n",
    "    - Masked Language Modeling:\n",
    "        - Some input tokens are randomly masked and the model is trained to predict context of surrounding tokens.\n",
    "        - Model learns contextual representations this way that capture the meaning of the entire sentence.\n",
    "    - Next Sentence Prediction:\n",
    "        - Model is given pairs of sentences and then trained to predict if the second sentence comes after the first.\n",

    "        - This happens by adding task-specific layers on top of the pre-trained model by training the entire model end-to-end on labeled data for the target task."
